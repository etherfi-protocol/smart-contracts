# etherfi-protocol smart-contracts

Smart Contracts for ether.fi ethereum staking protocol.

From 2024/02/15, we have migrated from our private repo to this public one.
We start with the shallow copy of the latest commit of the private one.

# EtherFi smart contracts setup

## Get Started

### Install Foundry

```zsh
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

### Update Foundry

```zsh
foundryup
```

### Install Submodules

```zsh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Formatter and Linter

Run `yarn` to install `package.json` which includes our formatter and linter. We will switch over to Foundry's sol formatter and linter once released.

### Set your environment variables

Check `.env.example` to see some of the environment variables you should have set in `.env` in order to run some of the commands.

### Compile Project

```zsh
forge build
```

### Run Project Tests

```zsh
forge test
```

### Run Project Fork Tests

```zsh
forge test --fork-url <your_rpc_url>>
```

### Build Troubleshooting Tips

In case you run into an issue of `forge` not being able to find a compatible version of solidity compiler for one of your contracts/scripts, you may want to install the solidity version manager `svm`. To be able to do so, you will need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed on your system and with it the accompanying package manager `cargo`. Once that is done, to install `svm` run the following command:

```zsh
cargo install svm-rs
```

To list the available versions of solidity compiler run:

```zsh
svm list
```

Make sure the version you need is in this list, or choose the closest one and install it:

```zsh
svm install "0.7.6"
```

### Inside your Foundry project working directory:

Install Yarn or Node:

```zsh
yarn or npm init
```

Install hardhat

```zsh
yarn add hardhat --save-dev
```

Setup your Hardhat project as you see fit in the same directory. (We assume a typescript setup)
If you have a ReadMe file and test folder already, move them off the root before creating your hardhat project. Then delete the HH generated ones and copy your original ones back.

```zsh
yarn hardhat
```

You will have to run the below every time you modify the foundry library. Open remappings.txt when done and make sure all remappings are correct. Sometimes weird remappings can be generated.

```zsh
forge remappings > remappings.txt
```

Now make the following changes to your Hardhat project.

```zsh
yarn add hardhat-preprocessor --save-dev
```

```zsh
Add import "hardhat-preprocessor"; to your hardhat.config.ts file.
```

```zsh
Add import fs from "fs"; to your hardhat.config.ts file.
```

Add the following function to your hardhat.config.ts file.

```zsh
function getRemappings() {
  return fs
    .readFileSync("remappings.txt", "utf8")
    .split("\n")
    .filter(Boolean) // remove empty lines
    .map((line) => line.trim().split("="));
}
```

Add the following to your exported HardhatUserConfig object:

```zsh
preprocess: {
  eachLine: (hre) => ({
    transform: (line: string) => {
      if (line.match(/^\s*import /i)) {
        for (const [from, to] of getRemappings()) {
          if (line.includes(from)) {
            line = line.replace(from, to);
            break;
          }
        }
      }
      return line;
    },
  }),
},
paths: {
  sources: "./src",
  cache: "./cache_hardhat",
},
```
