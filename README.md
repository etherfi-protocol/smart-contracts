# ether.fi Liquid Restaking Protocol



## Overview

The ether.fi Liquid Restaking Protocol represents the core infrastructure powering ether.fi's vision of becoming the most secure and efficient liquid staking solution in DeFi. This protocol enables:

- **Liquid Staking**: Seamless ETH staking with immediate liquidity through eETH
- **Native Restaking**: Effortless & Secure restaking of staked ETH. Restaking & AVS management is strictly controlled by the Protocol via ether.fi's AVS operator contracts ([link](https://github.com/etherfi-protocol/etherfi-avs-operator)). Restaking rewards are distributed via KING ([link](https://github.com/orgs/King-Protocol/repositories))
- **Massive Integration with DeFi**: Wide integration with DeFi protocols
- **Cross-Chain Capabilities**: Native support for cross-chain staking & bridging of weETH ([link](https://github.com/etherfi-protocol/weETH-cross-chain/))
- **Enterprise-Grade Security**: Rigorous security measures through audits, formal verification, and continuous monitoring
