## Summary

EFIP-1 proposes the establishment of the ether.fi Improvement Proposal (EFIP) process. This document outlines the framework and guidelines for creating and submitting EFIPs. The purpose is to standardize the method for proposing new features, improvements, and processes within the ether.fi ecosystem, ensuring transparency and community involvement in decision-making.



## Motivation

The introduction of the ether.fi Improvement Proposal (EFIP) process represents a proactive step towards improving the ether.fi ecosystem with a structured, transparent, and inclusive framework:

1. Provide a clear and consistent method for proposing changes.
2. Facilitate community discussion and input on proposed changes.
3. Create a historical archive of proposals and their outcomes.
4. Enhance the ability of contributors to track the progress and implementation of proposals.



## Proposal

The proposal is on the EFIP Process and the template for EFIP document [EFIP-template](efip-template.md):

1. **Draft**: Authors draft an EFIP using the provided template, detailing the summary, motivation, and technical specifications of the proposal.

2. **Review**: The draft EFIP is submitted to the ether.fi community for review. Community members can provide feedback and suggest revisions.

3. **Approval**: After addressing feedback and making necessary revisions, the EFIP is submitted for approval. The approval process involves a formal review by ether.fi core developers.

4. **Implementation**: Once approved, the proposal is implemented by the relevant contributors. Implementation details and progress are tracked and communicated to the community.

5. **Retro**: After implementation, the EFIP is archived and its retro is followed to review the outcomes and discuss the future extensions or missing pitfalls.
