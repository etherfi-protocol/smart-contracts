/**
 * The BucketLimiter contract is used to limit the rate of some action.
 * 
 * Buckets refill at a constant rate, and have a maximum capacity. Each time
 * the consume function is called, the bucket gets depleted by the provided
 * amount. If the bucket is empty, the consume function will return false
 * and the bucket will not be depleted. Rates are measured in units per 
 * second.
 * 
 * To limit storage usage to a single slot, the Bucket struct is packed into
 * a single word, meaning all fields are uint64.
 *
 * Examples:
 *
 * ```sol
 * BucketLimiter.Limit storage limit = BucketLimiter.create(100, 1);
 * limit.consume(10); // returns true, remaining = 90
 * limit.consume(80); // returns true, remaining = 10
 * limit.consume(20); // returns false, remaining = 10
 * // Wait 10 seconds (10 tokens get refilled)
 * limit.consume(20); // returns true, remaining = 0)
 * // Increase capacity
 * limit.setCapacity(200); // remaining = 0, capacity = 200
 * // Increase refill rate
 * limit.setRefillRate(2); // remaining = 0, capacity = 200, refillRate = 2
 * // Wait 10 seconds (20 tokens get refilled)
 * limit.consume(20); // returns true, remaining = 0
 * ```
 * 
 * Developers should notice that rate-limits are vulnerable to two attacks:
 * 1. Sybil-attacks: Rate limits should typically be global across all user
 *       accounts, otherwise an attacker can simply create many accounts to
 *       bypass the rate limit.
 * 2. DoS attacks: Rate limits should typically apply to actions with a
 *       friction such as a fee or a minimum stake time. Otherwise, an
 *       attacker can simply spam the action to deplete the rate limit.
